            <h2>Your Hub for Sneaker Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                Sneaker Vault is designed to help users explore a wide variety of sneakers 
                in a clean, user-friendly interface without the distraction of ads. 
                Our goal is to make it easy to compare options, discover new styles,
                and quickly find the pair that fits your needs.

            <h2>Smart Filtering & Search</h2>

            <p>
                The main way to begin finding sneakers is through the search bar. 
                As users type, we will perform primary filtering on the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional filters will appear on the left quarter of the screen to help 
                narrow down results even further.
            </p>

            <strong>Filter Options</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Price:</strong> adjusted using a slider</li>

            <h2>The <em style={{ color: 'purple' }}>Magic</em> Behind The Scenes</h2>
            <p>
                We fetch data from a sneaker API. Each shoe is represented as its own 
                sneaker card, including an image, the brand/model, and price of the shoe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sneaker Vault is built using <em>React</em>, allowing us to create dynamic, 
                responsive components and update sneaker listings in real time as users 
                search and filter.
